## How to use
OPTION 1: Install a browser with the ability to customize sites like [Arc browser](https://arc.net/). For Arc, create a "New Boost" while on x.com, copy and paste the code into the boost floating window. Css code into css tab and viceversa for js. Restart tab and enjoy. (I do this)

OPTION 2: Find an extension capable of applying custom css and js to a site. For example, [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en-US).
